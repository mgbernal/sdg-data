It is a legal requirement to register a birth in the UK within 42 days. There is no direct measure of number of children who are unregistered. As registration is comprehensive, a figure of 100% is used.\n\nInformation provided at birth registration is used to produce birth statistics, which are published separately for each of the UK countries. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) publish [birth statistics for England and Wales](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/livebirths). For more information, see the [user guide to birth statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/livebirths/methodologies/userguidetobirthstatistics#issues-affecting-the-quality-of-birth-registration-data).
