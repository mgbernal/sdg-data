Precious metals (particularly gold) have a high RME factor, so can have distinctive impact on the results. This is particularly true for the UK, who are responsible for more than three quarters of the EU\u2019s imports of gold. While the impact is minimal at the total level, it is more evident when looking at the material footprint of metal ores.","graph_type":"line","graph_title":"Material footprint, material footprint per capita, and material footprint per GDP","data_show_map":false,"data_keywords":"material footprint, environment","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Office for National Statistics (ONS)","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":2000,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"United Kingdom","source_url_1":"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/methodologies/measuringmaterialfootprintintheuk2008to2016","source_url_text_1":"Measuring material footprint in the UK - 2008 to 2016","source_release_date_1":"05/06/2019","source_next_release_1":"TBC","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official Statistic","source_contact_1":"environment.accounts@ons.gov.uk","source_active_2":true,"source_organisation_2":"Office for National Statistics (ONS)","source_periodicity_2":"Annual","source_earliest_available_2":1971,"source_geographical_coverage_2":"United Kingdom","source_url_2":"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/timeseries/ukpop/pop","source_url_text_2":"Population estimates","source_release_date_2":"26/06/2019","source_next_release_2":"01/06/2020","source_statistical_classification_2":"Official Statistic","source_contact_2":"pop.info@ons.gov.uk","source_active_3":true,"source_organisation_3":"Office for National Statistics (ONS)","source_periodicity_3":"Quarterly","source_earliest_available_3":1955,"source_geographical_coverage_3":"United Kingdom","source_url_3":"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/timeseries/abmi/pn2","source_url_text_3":"Gross Domestic Product - chained volume measures - Seasonally adjusted \u00a3m","source_release_date_3":"11/11/2019","source_next_release_3":"20/12/2019","source_statistical_classification_3":"Official Statistic","source_contact_3":"gdp@ons.gov.uk","source_other_info_3":"Based on GDP estimates published on 11/11/19","source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator_sort_order":"08-04-01","comments_limitations":"The choice of method used to calculate material footprint has an impact on the final estimates. In 2017, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) consulted extensively with the University of Leeds about developing further environmentally relevant metrics for material use and resource efficiency, particularly in carbon terms. As a result, the University of Leeds have developed a multi-regional input-output (MRIO) approach, using a specifically derived UK MRIO database to underpin calculations. These estimates and further information on the Eurostat and University of Leeds approach are published in the <a href= \"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/methodologies/measuringmaterialfootprintintheuk2008to2016\">Measuring material footprint</a> report.
