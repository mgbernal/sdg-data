IWRM was officially established in 1992 and is defined as \u201ca process which promotes the coordinated development and management of water, land and related resources in order to maximise economic and social welfare in an equitable manner without compromising the sustainability of vital ecosystems\u201d (GWP 2010). The concept of IWRM is measured in 4 main components - i) Enabling environment - this includes the policies, laws, plans and strategies which create the \u2018enabling environment\u2019 for IWRM; ii) Institutions - includes the range and roles of political, social, economic and administrative institutions that help to support the implementation of IWRM; iii) Management Instruments - The tools and activities that enable decision-makers and users to make rational and informed choices between alternative actions; iv) Financing - Budgeting and financing made available and used for water resources development and management from various sources. The indicator is based on a national survey structured around these four main components (UNEP 2016). Each component is split into two parts - questions concerning the \u2018National level\u2019 and \u2018Other levels\u2019 respectively. \u2018Other levels\u2019 includes sub-national (including provinces/states for federated countries), basin level, and the transboundary level as appropriate. These two parts address the wording of Target 6.5 \u2018implement [IWRM] at all levels \u2026\u2019. To further aid interpretation and comparison, the indicator results can be categorized in a similar way to the survey questions - Degree of implementation = Very low (0-9.9); Low (10-29.9); Medium-low (30-49.9); Medium-high (50-69.9); High (70-89.9); and Very high (90-100).","computation_calculations":"The indicator degree of implementation of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM), measured in per cent (%) from 0 (implementation not yet started) to 100 (fully implemented) is currently being measured in terms of different stages of development and implementation of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM).","reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"data_footnote":"This indicator shows the area of transboundary surface water bodies and aquifers, and the percentage of aquifer under operational agreements.
