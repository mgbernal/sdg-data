Missing - The number of people whose whereabouts is unknown since the hazardous event. It includes people who are presumed dead although there is no physical evidence. The data on number of deaths and number of missing are mutually exclusive. Affected - People who are affected, either directly or indirectly, by a hazardous event. Directly affected - People who have suffered injury, illness or other health effects; who were evacuated, displaced, relocated or have suffered direct damage to their livelihoods, economic, physical, social, cultural and environmental assets. Indirectly affected - People who have suffered consequences, other than or in addition to direct effects, over time due to disruption or changes in economy, critical infrastructures, basic services, commerce, work or social, health and psychological consequences. In this indicator, given the difficulties in assessing the full range of all affected (directly and indirectly), UNISDR proposes the use of an indicator that would estimate \u201cdirectly affected\u201d as a proxy for the number of affected. This indicator, while not perfect, comes from data widely available and could be used consistently across countries and over time to measure the achievement of the Target B of the Sendai Framework. [a] An open-ended intergovernmental expert working group on indicators and terminology relating to disaster risk reduction established by the General Assembly (resolution 69/284) is developing a set of indicators to measure global progress in the implementation of the Sendai Framework. These indicators will eventually reflect the agreements on the Sendai Framework indicators.","computation_calculations":"(Number of deaths / Population) * 1,000,000","reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"graph_type":"line","graph_title":"Deaths from exposure to natural forces per million population","data_show_map":false,"data_keywords":"DEFRA","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Office for National Statistics (ONS)","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":2013,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"England and Wales","source_url_1":"https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/articles/960.aspx","source_url_text_1":"Nomis - Mortality Statistics","source_release_date_1":"09/06/2017","source_next_release_1":"TBC","source_statistical_classification_1":"Non-Official","source_contact_1":"support@nomisweb.co.uk","source_active_2":true,"source_organisation_2":"Office for National Statistics (ONS)","source_periodicity_2":"Annual","source_earliest_available_2":1838,"source_geographical_coverage_2":"United Kingdom","source_url_2":"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/datasets/populationestimatesforukenglandandwalesscotlandandnorthernireland","source_url_text_2":"Population Estimates for UK, England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland","source_release_date_2":"22/06/2017","source_next_release_2":"01/06/2018","source_statistical_classification_2":"National Statistic","source_contact_2":"pop.info@ons.gsi.gov.uk","source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator_sort_order":"01-05-01","comments_limitations":"This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator.
