Plant and animal GRFA conserved in these facilities can be easily used in breeding programmes as well, even directly on-farm. The measure of trends in ex situ conserved materials provides an overall assessment of the extent to which we are managing to maintain and/or increase the total genetic diversity available for future use and thus protected from any permanent loss of genetic diversity which may occur in the natural habitat, i.e. in situ, or on-farm. The two components of the indicator, plant and animal GRFA, are separately counted. Plant genetic resources - The plant component is calculated as the number of accessions of plant genetic resources secured in conservation facilities under medium or long term conditions, where an \u2018accession\u2019 is defined as a distinct sample of seeds, planting materials or plants which is maintained in a genebank. <a href=\u201dhttp://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/7b79ee93-0f3c-5f58-9adc-5d4ef063f9c7/\u201d>Genebank Standards for Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture</a> set the benchmark for current scientific and technical best practices for conserving plant genetic resources, and support key international policy instruments for the conservation and use of plant genetic resources.

Animal genetic resources - The animal component is calculated as the number of local breeds stored within a genebank collection with an amount of genetic material stored which is required to reconstitute the breed (based on the Guidelines on Cryconservation of Animal Genetic Resources, FAO, 2012, accessible <a href=\u201dhttp://www.fao.org/docrep/016/i3017e/i3017e00.htm\u201d>here</a>).
