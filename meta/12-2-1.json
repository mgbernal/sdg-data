The total material footprint is the sum of the material footprint for biomass, fossil fuels, metal ores and non-metal ores. MF consumption reports the amount of primary materials required to serve final demand of a country and can be interpreted as an indicator for the material standard of living/level of capitalization of an economy. Per-capita MF describes the average material use for final demand. Domestic Material Consumption (DMC) and MF need to be looked at in combination as they cover the two aspects of the economy, production and consumption (See indicators 8.4.2 and 12.2.2). The DMC reports the actual amount of material in an economy, MF the virtual amount required across the whole supply chain to service final demand. A country can, for instance have a very high DMC because it has a large primary production sector for export or a very low DMC because it has outsourced most of the material intensive industrial process to other countries. The material footprint corrects for both phenomena.","computation_calculations":"Material Footprint (MF) is calculated as raw material equivalent of imports (RMEIM) plus domestic extraction (DE) minus raw material equivalents of exports (RMEEX). For the attribution of the primary material needs of final demand a global, multi-regional input-output (MRIO) framework is employed. The attribution method based on I-O analytical tools is described in detail in Wiedmann et al. 2015. It is based on the EORA MRIO framework developed by the University of Sydney, Australia (Lenzen et al. 2013) which is an internationally well-established and the most detailed and reliable MRIO framework available to date.","reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"graph_type":"line","graph_title":"Tonnes of material footprint per capita and per GDP (\u00a3m)","data_show_map":false,"data_keywords":"GDP","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Office for National Statistics (ONS)","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":2000,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"United Kingdom","source_url_1":"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/articles/ukenvironmentalaccountshowmuchmaterialistheukconsuming/ukenvironmentalaccountshowmuchmaterialistheukconsuming","source_url_text_1":"UK Environmental Accounts - How much material is the UK consuming?","source_release_date_1":"29/02/2016","source_next_release_1":"TBC","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official Statistic","source_contact_1":"environment.accounts@ons.gov.uk","source_active_2":true,"source_organisation_2":"Office for National Statistics (ONS)","source_periodicity_2":"Annual","source_earliest_available_2":1971,"source_geographical_coverage_2":"United Kingdom","source_url_2":"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates","source_url_text_2":"Population estimates","source_release_date_2":"22/06/2017","source_next_release_2":"01/06/2018","source_statistical_classification_2":"Official Statistic","source_contact_2":"pop.info@ons.gov.uk","source_active_3":true,"source_organisation_3":"Office for National Statistics (ONS)","source_periodicity_3":"Quarterly","source_earliest_available_3":1955,"source_geographical_coverage_3":"United Kingdom","source_url_3":"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/timeseries/abmi/pn2","source_url_text_3":"Gross Domestic Product - chained volume measures - Seasonally adjusted \u00a3m","source_release_date_3":"23/11/2017","source_next_release_3":"22/12/2017","source_statistical_classification_3":"Official Statistic","source_contact_3":"gdp@ons.gov.uk","source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator_sort_order":"12-02-01","comments_limitations":"The global material flows database is based on country material flow accounts from the European Union and Japan and estimated data for the rest of the world.
