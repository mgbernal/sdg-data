Homicide Index data are based on the year when the offence was recorded as a crime, not when the offence took place or when the case was heard in court. While in the vast majority of cases the offence will be recorded in the same year as it took place, this is not always the case. Caution is therefore needed when looking at longer-term homicide trends.","computation_calculations":"(Number of homicides in sex and age group / Population in sex and age group) * 100,000","reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"data_footnote":"1.
