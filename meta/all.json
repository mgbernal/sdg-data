These indicators will eventually reflect the agreements on the Sendai Framework indicators.","computation_calculations":"(Number of deaths / Population) * 1,000,000","un_designated_tier":"2","un_custodian_agency":"United Nations Office for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-01-05-01.pdf ","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 224 KB)","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Office for National Statistics (ONS)","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":"2013","source_geographical_coverage_1":"England and Wales","source_url_1":"https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/articles/960.aspx","source_url_text_1":"Nomis: Mortality Statistics","source_release_date_1":"09-06-2017","source_next_release_1":"To be announced","source_statistical_classification_1":"Non-Official","source_contact_1":"Nomis helpdesk 0191 334 2680, email support@nomisweb.co.uk","source_active_2":true,"source_organisation_2":"Office for National Statistics (ONS)","source_periodicity_2":"Annual","source_earliest_available_2":"1838","source_geographical_coverage_2":"United Kingdom","source_url_2":"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/datasets/populationestimatesforukenglandandwalesscotlandandnorthernireland","source_url_text_2":"Population Estimates for UK, England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland","source_release_date_2":"22-06-2017","source_next_release_2":"01-06-2018","source_statistical_classification_2":"National Statistic","source_contact_2":"Neil Park, pop.info@ons.gsi.gov.uk, Telephone +44 (0)1329 444661","source_active_3":false,"source_url_text_3":"Link to Source","source_active_4":false,"source_url_text_4":"Link to Source","source_active_5":false,"source_url_text_5":"Link to Source","reporting_status":"complete","published":true,"data_non_statistical":false,"graph_type":"line","graph_title":"Deaths from exposure to natural forces per million population","source_url_3":"Link to source","source_active_6":true,"source_url_text_6":"Link to source","data_show_map":false,"national_data_update_url_text":"2018-02-13: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/ONSdigital/sdg-data/commit/667a40361bd64fe01ac8c8151a7ef62f62850b4d","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2018-10-29: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/ONSdigital/sdg-data/commit/6afa85a16b5eb58800dac057316fba4d7055e636","page_content":"This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator and has not been identified in collaboration with topic experts.

Disposable income is the amount of money that households have available for spending and saving after direct taxes (such as Income Tax, National Insurance and Council Tax) and pension contributions have been accounted for. It includes earnings from employment, private pensions and investments as well as cash benefits provided by the state.  **Reflecting household size** The expenditure and income measures used in this analysis are all equivalised. Equivalisation is the process of accounting for the fact that households with many members are likely to need a higher income to achieve the same standard of living as households with fewer members.

The LCF is an annual survey of the expenditure and income of private households; people living in hotels, lodging houses and institutions such as old people\u2019s homes are excluded. It is the only data source to collect detailed data on both income and expenditure, thereby allowing analysis of the two measures.  As with all surveys, there are some limitations to be aware of. The LCF is known to not fully capture those at the poorest and richest ends of income distribution and suffers from non-response error . When analysing inequalities, this can impact on the representation of the target population (in this case, the bottom 40%) and the overall appearance of income distribution.   In international comparisons, data has been sourced from the World Bank, and data for the UK comes from Eurostat\u2019s  European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC).   The EU-SILC collects data on poverty, income, social exclusion and living conditions. In the international analysis, the total population and the target population (bottom 40%) are defined on a household level, before housing costs (BHC). Eurostat sets the reference year at T-1 from the survey year, therefore 2009 reference year will refer to 2010 survey data.   In addition, data from the World Bank is from 91 countries.

Missing income information is imputed. Disposable household income includes: all income from work (employee wages and self-employment earnings); private income from investment and property; transfers between households; all social transfers received in cash including old-age pensions. Note: Some of the income components are mandatory only from 2007: Imputed rent, Interest paid on mortgage, Employer's social insurance contributions. From the 2007 year on, all countries have to supply gross income information. The current definition of total household disposable income used for the calculation of EU-SILC based indicators excludes: imputed rent (i.e. money that one saves on full [market] rent by living in one's own accommodation or in accommodation rented at a price that is lower than the market rent); non monetary income components, in particular value of goods produced for own consumption, social transfers in kind and non-cash employee income except company cars. At risk of poverty rate is defined at cut-off point: 50% of median equivalised income. Equivalence scale: to take into account the impact of differences in household size and composition, the total disposable household income is \"equivalised\". The equivalised income attributed to each member of the household is calculated by dividing the total disposable income of the household by the equivalisation factor. Equivalisation factors can be determined in various ways. Eurostat applies an equivalisation factor calculated according to the OECD-modified scale first proposed in 1994 - which gives a weight of 1.0 to the first person aged 14 or more, a weight of 0.5 to other persons aged 14 or more and a weight of 0.3 to persons aged 0-13. Household definition: A 'private household' means \"a person living alone or a group of people who live together in the same private dwelling and share expenditures, including the joint provision of the essentials of living\". EU-SILC implementing regulation number 1983/2003 on updated definitions, defines households in terms of sharing household expenses and (for non-permanent members) in terms of duration of stay and (for temporarily absent members) in terms of duration of absence.","computation_calculations":"Calculated figures provided by source.","computation_disaggregation":"Age, Sex, and Age by Sex.","comments_limitations":"For further information please see eurostat Income and living conditions (ilc) @ http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/metadata/en/ilc_esms.htm","un_designated_tier":"3","un_custodian_agency":"United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) World Bank (WB)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/metadata-compilation/Metadata-Goal-10.pdf ","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 4.0 MB)","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Eurostat","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":2005,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"United Kingdom","source_url_1":"http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/en/web/products-datasets/-/ILC_LI02","source_url_text_1":"At-risk-of-poverty rate by poverty threshold, age and sex - EU-SILC survey ","source_release_date_1":"12-12-2017","source_next_release_1":"To be announced","source_statistical_classification_1":"Non-Official","source_active_2":false,"source_url_text_2":"Link to Source","source_active_3":false,"source_url_text_3":"Link to Source","source_active_4":false,"source_url_text_4":"Link to Source","source_active_5":false,"source_url_text_5":"Link to Source","reporting_status":"complete","published":true,"data_non_statistical":false,"graph_type":"line","graph_title":"Percentage of people in households at risk of poverty (below 50% of median UK household income)","national_data_update_url_text":"2017-11-08: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/ONSdigital/sdg-data/commit/df46bc882cfd4aad88f3d6bfe1efd2fd6d3af894","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2018-10-11: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/ONSdigital/sdg-data/commit/c65d1a32b45b64ac6ce41dcc156ca91d3079e511","page_content":"Data follows the UN specification for this indicator and has been indentified in collaboration with topic experts.\n  \nThe Sustainable Development Goals is a collaborative project, if you have any feedback or suggestions for data please contact us at <SustainableDevelopment@ons.gov.uk>\n\n\n"},"10-3-1":{"indicator":"10.3.1","layout":"indicator","permalink":"/10-3-1/","sdg_goal":"10","indicator_sort_order":"10-03-01","title":"Proportion of population reporting having personally felt discriminated against or harassed in the previous 12 months on the basis of a ground of discrimination prohibited under international human rights law","target_id":"10.3","target":"Ensure equal opportunity and reduce inequalities of outcome, including by eliminating discriminatory laws, policies and practices and promoting appropriate legislation, policies and action in this regard","indicator_name":"Proportion of population reporting having personally felt discriminated against or harassed in the previous 12 months on the basis of a ground of discrimination prohibited under international human rights law","national_indicator_available":"Number of hate crimes recorded by the police per 1,000 population","national_indicator_periodicity":"Annual","national_geographical_coverage":"England and Wales","national_earliest_available_data":"2011","admin_next_release":"22-06-18","admin_contact_details":"SustainableDevelopment@ons.gov.uk","computation_units":"Rate per 1,000 population","computation_definitions":"Grounds of discrimination prohibited under international human rights law, as enshrined in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights and subsequently elaborated upon by international human rights mechanisms, include ethnicity, sex, age, income, geographic location, disability, religion, migratory or displacement status, civil status, sexual orientation and gender identity. In the United Kingdom, hate crime is defined as \u2018any criminal offence which is perceived, by the victim or any other person, to be motivated by hostility or prejudice towards someone based on a personal characteristic.\u2019 This common definition was agreed in 2007 by the police, Crown Prosecution Service, Prison Service (now the National Offender Management Service) and other agencies that make up the criminal justice system. There are five centrally monitored strands of hate crime: race or ethnicity; religion or beliefs; sexual orientation; disability; and transgender identity.

Other official flows (OOF): Other official flows (excluding officially supported export credits) are defined as transactions by the official sector which do not meet the conditions for eligibility as ODA, either because they are not primarily aimed at development, or because they are not sufficiently concessional (http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/documentupload/DCDDAC(2016)3FINAL.pdf - Para 24). Bilateral Aid:  Bilateral aid covers all aid provided by donor countries when the recipient country, sector or project is known. Bilateral aid also includes aid that is channelled through a multilateral organisation where the government department determines the country, sector or theme that the funds will be spent on. Multilateral Aid:  This is aid delivered in the form of core contributions to organisations on the DAC List of Multilateral Organisations.  Purpose Codes: The DAC (Development Assistance Committee) Secretariat maintains various code lists which are used by donors to report on their aid flows to the DAC databases.  In addition, these codes are used to classify information in the DAC databases. The sector classification codes used can be found on the OECD website (http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/purposecodessectorclassification.htm).","computation_calculations":"The raw data underlying the United Kingdom Statistics on International Development was summed around appropriate aid description CRS codes, bilateral and multilateral classification, donor recipient countries, and type of aid codes.","computation_numerator":"Net Total Overseas Development Aid (\u00a3000s)","computation_denominator":"Not Applicable","computation_disaggregation":"This data can be disaggregated by Flow of Aid (Bilateral/Multilateral), Aid Description (CRS Code), Recipient Region and Country, and Type of Aid (e.g. Debt relief [F01], Scholarships/training in donor country [E01], etc.).

Bilateral aid also includes aid that is channelled through a multilateral organisation where the government department determines the country, sector or theme that the funds will be spent on. Multilateral Aid:  This is aid delivered in the form of core contributions to organisations on the DAC List of Multilateral Organisations.  Purpose Codes: The DAC (Development Assistance Committee) Secretariat maintains various code lists which are used by donors to report on their aid flows to the DAC databases.

Many protected areas in the UK cover the same physical parcels of land, but for different reasons; as a result the designation types can overlap.  For example, it is possible for an individual site to be designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), Special Area of Conservation (SAC), Special Protection Area (SPA), Ramsar site and National Nature Reserve (NNR), and could also be part of a National Park, an AONB (Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty) or National Scenic Area (NSA).","computation_calculations":"Total extent of protected areas at-sea is calculated using a program written by JNCC which uses a number of site designation files as input, and calculates a set of non-overlapping polygons for that entire set of designations for each year.

It is based on genuine changes in the number of species in each category of extinction risk on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (IUCN 2015) is expressed as changes in an index ranging from 0 to 1.","computation_calculations":"The Red List Index is calculated at a point in time by first multiplying the number of species in each Red List Category by a weight (ranging from 1 for \u2018Near Threatened\u2019 to 5 for \u2018Extinct\u2019 and \u2018Extinct in the Wild\u2019) and summing these values. This is then divided by a maximum threat score which is the total number of species multiplied by the weight assigned to the \u2018Extinct\u2019 category. This final value is subtracted from 1 to give the Red List Index value. Mathematically this calculation is expressed as: RLIt = 1 \u2013 [(Ss Wc(t,s) / (WEX * N). Where Wc(t,s) is the weight for category (c) at time (t) for species (s) (the weight for \u2018Critically Endangered\u2019 = 4, \u2018Endangered\u2019 = 3, \u2018Vulnerable\u2019 = 2, \u2018Near Threatened\u2019 = 1, \u2018Least Concern\u2019 = 0. \u2018Critically Endangered\u2019 species tagged as \u2018Possibly Extinct\u2019 or \u2018Possibly Extinct in the Wild\u2019 are assigned a weight of 5); WEX = 5, the weight assigned to \u2018Extinct\u2019 or \u2018Extinct in the Wild\u2019 species; and N is the total number of assessed species, excluding those assessed as Data Deficient in the current time period, and those considered to be \u2018Extinct\u2019 in the year the set of species was first assessed.","comments_limitations":"The Red List Index formula requires that: \n\u00b7 Exactly the same set of species is included in all time periods, and \u00b7 The only Red List Category changes are those resulting from genuine improvement or deterioration in status (i.e., excluding changes resulting from improved knowledge or taxonomic revisions), and  \u00b7  Data Deficient species are excluded\nIn many cases, species lists will change slightly from one assessment to the next (e.g., owing to taxonomic revisions). The conditions can therefore be met by retrospectively adjusting earlier Red List categorizations using current information and taxonomy. This is achieved by assuming that the current Red List Categories for the taxa have applied since the set of species was first assessed for the Red List, unless there is information to the contrary that genuine status changes have occurred. Such information is often contextual (e.g., relating to the known history of habitat loss within the range of the species). If there is insufficient information available for a newly added species, it is not incorporated into the Red List Index until it is assessed for a second time, at which point earlier assessments are retrospectively corrected by extrapolating recent trends in population, range, habitat and threats, supported by additional information. To avoid spurious results from biased selection of species, Red List Indices are typically calculated only for taxonomic groups in which all species worldwide have been assessed for the Red List, or for samples of species that have been systematically or randomly selected.\nThe methods and scientific basis for the Red List Index were described by Butchart et al. (2004, 2005, 2007, 2010). For further information, please refer to global metadata @ https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-15-05-01.pdf\nOver the past thirty years, numerous lists of conservation status have been produced: Red Lists, Biodiversity Action Plan Priority Lists, species listed on European Directives, species listed on the Schedules of the Wildlife & Countryside Act, together with lists of rare and scarce species. There is considerable overlap between these and some species appear on several of them. For example, the otter Lutra lutra, and the marsh saxifrage Saxifraga hirculus have as many as six \u201cbadges\". JNCC has attempted to collate many of the current lists into one place and make this available to users as a downloadable spreadsheet of species designations (http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/page-3408).\nJNCC will incorporate updates and corrections as necessary. If a source list, for example a red data book, has been reviewed in whole or in part, JNCC has had to decide whether or not to archive some or all of the content of the previous list. This has not always been straightforward, particularly in the case of some of the invertebrate red listings where some, but not all of the previously published list, have been reviewed and the status of the review is regarded by many as being \"provisional\". Nevertheless, we wanted to avoid the confusing situation where, for example, a species was listed as being \"vulnerable\" on one listing and \"critically endangered\" on another listing with the same geographical focus.\nRe-use of information in the Conservation Designations Spreadsheet is subject to the terms of the Open Government Licence, which means it may be used and distributed freely with only a few conditions.

In the United Kingdom, hate crime is defined as \u2018any criminal offence which is perceived, by the victim or any other person, to be motivated by hostility or prejudice towards someone based on a personal characteristic.\u2019 This common definition was agreed in 2007 by the police, Crown Prosecution Service, Prison Service (now the National Offender Management Service) and other agencies that make up the criminal justice system. There are five centrally monitored strands of hate crime: race or ethnicity; religion or beliefs; sexual orientation; disability; and transgender identity. In the process of recording a crime, police can flag an offence as being motivated by one or more of the five monitored strands listed above (for example, an offence can be motivated by hostility towards the victim\u2019s race and religion).

The World Bank, IMF and UNDP participate as observers. Official development assistance (ODA): The DAC defines ODA as \u201cthose flows to countries and territories on the DAC List of ODA Recipients and to multilateral institutions which are i) provided by official agencies, including state and local governments, or by their executive agencies; and ii) each transaction is administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective; and is concessional in character and conveys a grant element of at least 25 per cent (calculated at a rate of discount of 10 per cent) (http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm). Other official flows (OOF): Other official flows (excluding officially supported export credits) are defined as transactions by the official sector which do not meet the conditions for eligibility as ODA, either because they are not primarily aimed at development, or because they are not sufficiently concessional (http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/documentupload/DCDDAC(2016)3FINAL.pdf - Para 24). Bilateral Aid:  Bilateral aid covers all aid provided by donor countries when the recipient country, sector or project is known. Bilateral aid also includes aid that is channelled through a multilateral organisation where the government department determines the country, sector or theme that the funds will be spent on. Multilateral Aid:  This is aid delivered in the form of core contributions to organisations on the DAC List of Multilateral Organisations.  Purpose Codes: The DAC (Development Assistance Committee) Secretariat maintains various code lists which are used by donors to report on their aid flows to the DAC databases.  In addition, these codes are used to classify information in the DAC databases. The sector classification codes used can be found on the OECD website (http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/purposecodessectorclassification.htm).","computation_calculations":"The raw data underlying the United Kingdom Statistics on International Development was summed around appropriate aid description CRS codes, bilateral and multilateral classification, donor recipient countries, and type of aid codes.

Other official flows (OOF): Other official flows (excluding officially supported export credits) are defined as transactions by the official sector which do not meet the conditions for eligibility as ODA, either because they are not primarily aimed at development, or because they are not sufficiently concessional (http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/documentupload/DCDDAC(2016)3FINAL.pdf - Para 24). Bilateral Aid:  Bilateral aid covers all aid provided by donor countries when the recipient country, sector or project is known. Bilateral aid also includes aid that is channelled through a multilateral organisation where the government department determines the country, sector or theme that the funds will be spent on.  Multilateral Aid:  This is aid delivered in the form of core contributions to organisations on the DAC List of Multilateral Organisations.  Purpose Codes: The DAC (Development Assistance Committee) Secretariat maintains various code lists which are used by donors to report on their aid flows to the DAC databases.  In addition, these codes are used to classify information in the DAC databases. The sector classification codes used can be found on the OECD website (http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/purposecodessectorclassification.htm).","computation_calculations":"The raw data underlying the United Kingdom Statistics on International Development was summed around appropriate aid description CRS codes, bilateral and multilateral classification, donor recipient countries, and type of aid codes. The codes used to measure net ODA to the agriculture sector sit under DAC 5 Code 311 with the addition of CRS code 43040 (Rural Development) as defined by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal Metadata for Indicator 2.a.2.","computation_numerator":"Net Overseas Development Aid to the Agriculture Sector (\u00a3 000\u2019s)","computation_denominator":"Not Applicable","computation_disaggregation":"This data can be disaggregated by Flow of Aid (Bilateral/Multilateral) and Aid Category/Description (DAC 5/CRS Code). Flow of Aid (Bilateral/Multilateral) can be disaggregated by other disaggregation.","comments_limitations":"Figures may not sum to totals due to roundings.  In the CRS (Creditor Reporting System), data on the sector of destination are recorded using 5-digit purpose codes.  The first three digits of the code refer to the corresponding DAC5 sector or category.  Each CRS code belongs to one and only one DAC5 category.  Generally, the last two digits of the CRS purpose code are sequential and not hierarchical i.e., each CRS code stands for itself and can be selected individually or grouped to create sub-sectors. The Governance and civil society, general sector is an exception where purpose codes are hierarchically structured.   It is not possible to track directly the destination or purpose of UK funding to the general core budgets of the multilateral organisations. However a good indication of where UK funding goes is provided by OECD DAC data where the multilaterals report aid spend by country and sector. Therefore the multilateral data are estimates which have been calculated on the basis of the UK's share of the multilaterals' reported aid spending to the OECD.  The OECD data cover most of the main multilaterals the UK funds.  About 15% of the UK's core multilateral funding is not covered by the OECD data, and this unreported spending is allocated to the developing countries unspecified category.   More details on the estimates' quality are found in the Imputed multilateral share quality report (Statistics on International Development 2016).","un_designated_tier":"1","un_custodian_agency":"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-02-0A-02.pdf ","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 210 KB)","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Department for International Development (DfID)","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":2009,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"United Kingdom","source_url_1":"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/statistics-on-international-development-2016","source_url_text_1":"Statistics on International Development 2016","source_release_date_1":"17-11-2016","source_next_release_1":"17-11-2017","source_statistical_classification_1":"National Statistic","source_contact_1":"enquiry@dfid.gov.uk, Telephone (UK only), 0300 200 3343","source_other_info_1":"Awaiting update.

Evidence from epidemiological studies have shown that exposure to air pollution is linked, among others, to the important diseases taken into account in this estimate: Acute respiratory infections in young children (estimated under 5 years of age); Cerebrovascular diseases (stroke) in adults (estimated above 25 years); Ischaemic heart diseases (IHD) in adults (estimated above 25 years); Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults (estimated above 25 years); and Lung cancer in adults (estimated above 25 years).","computation_calculations":"Attributable mortality is calculated by first combining information on the increased (or relative) risk of a disease resulting from exposure, with information on how widespread the exposure is in the population (e.g. the annual mean concentration of particulate matter to which the population is exposed, proportion of population relying primarily on polluting fuels for cooking). This allows calculation of the 'population attributable fraction' (PAF), which is the fraction of disease seen in a given population that can be attributed to the exposure (e.g in that case of both the annual mean concentration of particulate matter and exposure to polluting fuels for cooking). Applying this fraction to the total burden of disease (e.g. cardiopulmonary disease expressed as deaths), gives the total number of deaths that results from exposure to that particular risk factor (in the example given above, to ambient and household air pollution).

Our mid-year population estimates are updated figures using the most recent census, allowing for births, deaths, net migration and ageing of the population.  The population estimates used are the most up-to-date when rates are produced. The specific population estimates used to calculate rates are detailed alongside published tables. Sometimes it is necessary to revise mortality rates following population estimate revisions. Any revisions to mortality rates are footnoted on tables. Further information on population estimates, and their methodology is available. Final cause of death: The conditions mentioned on the death certificate are used to derive an underlying cause of death. In some cases, more information on cause of death may become available at a later stage after the death has been registered, such that the underlying cause may be subsequently amended. Around 0.1% of deaths have their underlying cause amended (Table 6). This amended or final cause is used in mortality statistics. Sometimes the later information becomes available only after the annual extract has been taken. Users with access to individual records of deaths as shown in the public record (which is never amended) may consequently find some differences with published statistics.","computation_calculations":"Number of deaths from unsafe water, unsafe sanitation and lack of hygiene (exposure to unsafe WASH services) in a year, divided by the population, and multiplied by 1,000,000.","computation_numerator":"Deaths attributable to unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene focusing on inadequate WASH services.","computation_denominator":"Population x 1,000,000","computation_disaggregation":"Sex, Country, Cause of Death","comments_limitations":"Data rely on (a) statistics on WASH services (6.1, 6.2 and 6.3), which are well assessed in almost all countries, and (b) data on deaths.

The World Bank, IMF and UNDP participate as observers. Official development assistance (ODA): The DAC defines ODA as \u201cthose flows to countries and territories on the DAC List of ODA Recipients and to multilateral institutions which are i) provided by official agencies, including state and local governments, or by their executive agencies; and ii) each transaction is administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective; and is concessional in character and conveys a grant element of at least 25 per cent (calculated at a rate of discount of 10 per cent) (http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm). Other official flows (OOF): Other official flows (excluding officially supported export credits) are defined as transactions by the official sector which do not meet the conditions for eligibility as ODA, either because they are not primarily aimed at development, or because they are not sufficiently concessional (http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/documentupload/DCDDAC(2016)3FINAL.pdf - Para 24). Bilateral Aid:  Bilateral aid covers all aid provided by donor countries when the recipient country, sector or project is known. Bilateral aid also includes aid that is channelled through a multilateral organisation where the government department determines the country, sector or theme that the funds will be spent on. Multilateral Aid:  This is aid delivered in the form of core contributions to organisations on the DAC List of Multilateral Organisations.  Purpose Codes: The DAC (Development Assistance Committee) Secretariat maintains various code lists which are used by donors to report on their aid flows to the DAC databases.  In addition, these codes are used to classify information in the DAC databases. The sector classification codes used can be found on the OECD website (http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/purposecodessectorclassification.htm).","computation_calculations":"The raw data underlying the United Kingdom Statistics on International Development was summed around appropriate aid description CRS codes, bilateral and multilateral classification, donor recipient countries, and type of aid codes.

The World Bank, IMF and UNDP participate as observers. Official development assistance (ODA): The DAC defines ODA as \u201cthose flows to countries and territories on the DAC List of ODA Recipients and to multilateral institutions which are i) provided by official agencies, including state and local governments, or by their executive agencies; and ii) each transaction is administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective; and is concessional in character and conveys a grant element of at least 25 per cent (calculated at a rate of discount of 10 per cent) (http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm). Other official flows (OOF): Other official flows (excluding officially supported export credits) are defined as transactions by the official sector which do not meet the conditions for eligibility as ODA, either because they are not primarily aimed at development, or because they are not sufficiently concessional (http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/documentupload/DCDDAC(2016)3FINAL.pdf - Para 24). Bilateral Aid:  Bilateral aid covers all aid provided by donor countries when the recipient country, sector or project is known. Bilateral aid also includes aid that is channelled through a multilateral organisation where the government department determines the country, sector or theme that the funds will be spent on. Multilateral Aid:  This is aid delivered in the form of core contributions to organisations on the DAC List of Multilateral Organisations. Purpose Codes: The DAC (Development Assistance Committee) Secretariat maintains various code lists which are used by donors to report on their aid flows to the DAC databases.  In addition, these codes are used to classify information in the DAC databases. The sector classification codes used can be found on the OECD website (http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/purposecodessectorclassification.htm). Scholarships: Financial aid awards for individual students and contributions to trainees. The beneficiary students and trainees are nationals of developing countries. Financial aid awards include bilateral grants to students registered for systematic instruction in private or public institutions of higher education to follow full-time studies or training courses in the donor country. Estimated tuition costs of students attending schools financed by the donor but not receiving individual grants are not included here, but under item imputed student costs (CRS sector code 1520). Training costs relate to contributions for trainees from developing countries receiving mainly non-academic, practical or vocational training in the donor country.","computation_calculations":"The total volume of official development assistance flows for post-secondary education falls under DAC 5 Code 114.","comments_limitations":"The figures for the indicator were obtained by using the \u201cSUMIFS\u201d function to gather figures from the \u201cdata underlying SID 2016\u201d dataset.","un_designated_tier":"1","un_custodian_agency":"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-04-0B-01.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 211 KB)","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Department for International Development (DfID)","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":"2009","source_geographical_coverage_1":"United Kingdom","source_url_1":"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/statistics-on-international-development-2016","source_url_text_1":"Statistics on International Development 2016","source_release_date_1":"17-11-2016","source_next_release_1":"17-11-2017","source_statistical_classification_1":"National Statistic","source_contact_1":"enquiry@dfid.gov.uk, Telephone (UK only), 0300 200 3343","source_active_2":false,"source_url_text_2":"Link to Source","source_active_3":false,"source_url_text_3":"Link to Source","source_active_4":false,"source_url_text_4":"Link to Source","source_active_5":false,"source_url_text_5":"Link to Source","reporting_status":"complete","published":true,"data_non_statistical":false,"graph_title":"Flow of official development assistance (ODA) for post-secondary education","graph_type":"line","data_show_map":false,"source_url_3":"Link to source","source_active_6":true,"source_url_text_6":"Link to source","national_data_update_url_text":"2017-10-27: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/ONSdigital/sdg-data/commit/a56c95deb7a7f276c4a3300d5d78c4f6fe166448","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2018-10-11: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/ONSdigital/sdg-data/commit/c65d1a32b45b64ac6ce41dcc156ca91d3079e511","page_content":"This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator and has not been identified in collaboration with topic experts.

It includes acts of abusive sexual contact, forced engagement in sexual acts, attempted or completed sexual acts without consent, incest, sexual harassment, etc. In intimate partner relationships, experiencing sexual violence is commonly defined as being forced to have sexual intercourse, having sexual intercourse out of fear for what the partner might do, and/or being forced to so something sexual that the woman considers humiliating or degrading; iii) Psychological violence includes a range of behaviours that encompass acts of emotional abuse and controlling behaviour. These often coexist with acts of physical and sexual violence by intimate partners and are acts of violence in themselves. For a more detailed definition of physical, sexual and psychological violence against women see Guidelines for Producing Statistics on Violence against Women- Statistical Surveys (UN, 2014). According to the UN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women (1993), Violence against Women is \u201cAny act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life.

Violence against women shall be understood to encompass, but not be limited to, the following: Physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family [\u2026]\u201d. See here for full definition: http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/48/a48r104.htm Intimate partner violence includes any abuse perpetrated by a current or former partner within the context of marriage, cohabitation or any other formal or informal union. The different forms of violence included in the indicator are defined as follows: 1. Physical violence consists of acts aimed at physically hurting the victim and include, but are not limited to, pushing, grabbing, twisting the arm, pulling the hair, slapping, kicking, biting or hitting with the fist or object, trying to strangle or suffocate, burning or scalding on purpose, or threatening or attacking with some sort of weapon, gun or knife. 2. Sexual violence is defined as any sort of harmful or unwanted sexual behaviour that is imposed on someone. It includes acts of abusive sexual contact, forced engagement in sexual acts, attempted or completed sexual acts without consent, incest, sexual harassment, etc. In intimate partner relationships, experiencing sexual violence is commonly defined as being forced to have sexual intercourse, having sexual intercourse out of fear for what the partner might do, and/or being forced to so something sexual that the woman considers humiliating or degrading. 3. Psychological violence includes a range of behaviours that encompass acts of emotional abuse and controlling behaviour. These often coexist with acts of physical and sexual violence by intimate partners and are acts of violence in themselves. For a more detailed definition of physical, sexual and psychological violence against women see Guidelines for Producing Statistics on Violence against Women- Statistical Surveys (UN, 2014).","computation_calculations":"The theory underpinning this calculation: taking the total number of adults aged 16 to 59 in England and Wales who experienced any domestic abuse in the past 12 months and divided this by the total number of adults with the same age category in England/Wales and multiplied by 100.","computation_disaggregation":"The following types of disaggregation are available: Age groups (16-19,20-24,25-34,35-44,45-54,55-59), English region and Wales: (North East, North West, Yorkshire and the Humber, East Midlands, West Midlands, East of England, London, South East, South West, Wales), Household Income: (Less than \u00a310,000 ,\u00a310,000 to less than \u00a320,000,\u00a320,000 to less than \u00a330,000,\u00a330,000 to less than \u00a340,000,\u00a340,000 to less than \u00a350,000,\u00a350,000 or more, No income stated or not enough information provided), Ethnic Group: (White, White - English/Welsh/Scottish/Northern Irish/British, White - Irish, White - Any other white background, Mixed/multiple ethnic groups, Mixed - White and Black Caribbean, Mixed - White and Black African, Mixed - White and Asian, Mixed - Any other Mixed/Multiple ethnic background, Asian/Asian British, Asian - Indian, Asian - Pakistani, Asian - Bangladeshi, Asian - Chinese, Asian - Any other Asian background, Black/African/Caribbean/Black British, Black - African, Black - Caribbean, Black - Any other Black/African/Caribbean background, Other ethnic group, Other ethnic group - Arab, Other ethnic group - Any other ethnic group), Long-standing illness or disability: (Long-standing illness or disability, Limits activities, Does not limit activities, No long-standing illness or disability) Marital Status: (Married/ civil partnered, Cohabiting, S ingle, Separated, Divorced/ legally dissolved partnership, Widowed) Employment Status: (Employed, Unemployed, Inactive, Student, Looking after family/home, Long-term/temporarily sick/ill, Retired, Other inactive) Occupation: (Managerial and professional occupations, Intermediate occupations, Routine and manual occupations, Never worked and long-term unemployed) Highest Qualification: (Full-time students, Not classified, Degree or diploma, Apprenticeship or A/AS level, O level/GCSE, Other, No qualifications) Hours out of home on an average weekday: (Less than 3 hours, 3 hours less than 7 hours, 7 hours or longer) Number of evening visits to bar in last month: (None, Less than once a week, Once a week or more often) Number of visits to nightclub in last month:  (None, Less than once a week, Once a week or more often) Structure of household: (No children, Adults and child(ren),Single adult and child(ren)) Tenure: (Owner occupiers, Social renters, Private renters) Accommodation Type: (Houses, Detached, Semi-detached, Terraced, Flats/maisonettes) Output area classification: (Rural residents, Cosmopolitans, Ethnicity central, Multicultural metropolitans, Urbanites, Suburbanites, Constrained city dwellers, Hard-pressed living) Area Type: ( Urban, Rural) Level of physical disorder: (High, Not high) Employment Deprivation Index: (20% most deprived output areas, Other output areas, 20% least deprived output areas).

It is assessed against the scale of high, good, moderate, poor and bad. The results published each year relate to data reported in that year under the Water Framework Directive. The ecological status of surface waters is assessed according to the following criteria: Biological quality (measured by composition and abundance of specified elements such as fish, benthic invertebrates, aquatic flora); Hydromorphological quality (measured by reference to elements such as river continuity, channel patterns, dynamics of flow or substrate of the river bed); and Physico-chemical quality (measured by reference to elements such as temperature, oxygenation, pH, nutrient conditions and the concentrations of specific pollutants [synthetic and non-synthetic]). The chemical status of surface waters is assessed according to the following criteria: Chemical quality (measured by reference to environmental quality standards for chemical substances at European level). These standards specify maximum annual average concentrations for specific water pollutants. The specific requirements differ depending on which type of surface water body is being monitored. Chemical status is measured as either good or fail. If part of a water body fails on any one of the criteria monitored, it will fail to achieve or lose good status. This is described as the \"one out all out\" approach.","computation_calculations":"The percentage of water bodies in each status class has been calculated based on the total number of water bodies assessed in each year.","computation_numerator":"Number of water bodies in status class","computation_denominator":"Total number of water bodies assessed in each year","computation_disaggregation":"Water body type and status class","comments_limitations":"\u00b7 Some small differences exist in the way the administrations and environment agencies implement the methods and tools for assessing water body status. The introduction of new Water Framework Directive monitoring data and classification standards (including a new baseline adopting all of the new standards, tools, designations and water body boundaries) in 2014 has led to a step change in the number of water bodies assessed as being in each status class in following years. The formal reporting of new standards in cycle 2 of Water Framework Directive has used the second cycle plans published in 2015.  The introduction of reporting the cycle 2 standards has differed amongst the UK countries. \u00b7 The percentage of water bodies in each status class has been calculated based on the total number of water bodies assessed in each year. The number of water body assessments included varies slightly from year to year: 10,832 water body assessments were included in 2009; 10,761 in 2010; 10,782 in 2011; 10,704 in 2012; 10,763 in 2013; 10,799 in 2014; 10,379 in 2015 and 9,297 in 2016. This reduction in the number assessed in 2016 was primarily due England moving to cycle 2, and the removal of a number of water bodies that were below the 10km2 catchment area in line with guidance.","un_designated_tier":"3","un_custodian_agency":"United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) (GEMS/Water)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/metadata-compilation/Metadata-Goal-6.pdf ","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 4.0 MB)","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra)","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":"2009","source_geographical_coverage_1":"United Kingdom","source_url_1":"http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/page-4250-theme=default","source_url_text_1":"Surface water status","source_release_date_1":"01-09-2017","source_next_release_1":"To be announced","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official Statistic","source_contact_1":"Joint Nature Conservation Committee Monkstone House City Road Peterborough PE1 1JY, Tel 01733 562626 Fax 01733 555948 Email comment@jncc.gov.uk ","source_active_2":false,"source_url_text_2":"Link to Source","source_active_3":false,"source_url_text_3":"Link to Source","source_active_4":false,"source_url_text_4":"Link to Source","source_active_5":false,"source_url_text_5":"Link to Source","reporting_status":"complete","published":true,"data_non_statistical":false,"graph_title":"Percentage of UK surface water bodies awarded \u2018Good\u2019 or \u2018High\u2019, by water body type, under the Water Framework Directive.","graph_type":"line","data_show_map":false,"source_url_3":"Link to source","source_active_6":true,"source_url_text_6":"Link to source","national_data_update_url_text":"2018-09-26: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/ONSdigital/sdg-data/commit/a8523d4fd74f865c68d1979122a3f9fb557fbaec","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2018-10-11: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/ONSdigital/sdg-data/commit/c65d1a32b45b64ac6ce41dcc156ca91d3079e511","page_content":"Data follows the UN specification for this indicator; however it has not been identified in collaboration with topic experts.

The World Bank, IMF and UNDP participate as observers. Official development assistance (ODA): The DAC defines ODA as \u201cthose flows to countries and territories on the DAC List of ODA Recipients and to multilateral institutions which are i) provided by official agencies, including state and local governments, or by their executive agencies; and ii) each transaction is administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective; and is concessional in character and conveys a grant element of at least 25 per cent (calculated at a rate of discount of 10 per cent) (http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm). Other official flows (OOF): Other official flows (excluding officially supported export credits) are defined as transactions by the official sector which do not meet the conditions for eligibility as ODA, either because they are not primarily aimed at development, or because they are not sufficiently concessional (http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/documentupload/DCDDAC(2016)3FINAL.pdf - Para 24). Bilateral Aid:  Bilateral aid covers all aid provided by donor countries when the recipient country, sector or project is known. Bilateral aid also includes aid that is channelled through a multilateral organisation where the government department determines the country, sector or theme that the funds will be spent on. Multilateral Aid:  This is aid delivered in the form of core contributions to organisations on the DAC List of Multilateral Organisations.  Purpose Codes: The DAC (Development Assistance Committee) Secretariat maintains various code lists which are used by donors to report on their aid flows to the DAC databases.  In addition, these codes are used to classify information in the DAC databases. The sector classification codes used can be found on the OECD website (http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/purposecodessectorclassification.htm). \u201cInternational cooperation and capacity-building support\u201d implies aid (most of it quantifiable) in the form of grants or loans by external support agencies. The amount of water and sanitation-related Official Development Assistance (ODA) can be used as a proxy for this, captured by OECD Creditor Reporting  System (CRS). ODA is defined as flows of official financing administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as the main objective, and which are concessional in character with a grant element of at least 25 per cent (using a fixed 10 per cent rate of discount). By convention, ODA flows comprise contributions of donor government agencies, at all levels, to developing countries (\u201cbilateral ODA\u201d) and to multilateral institutions. ODA receipts, from a recipient perspective, comprise disbursements by bilateral donors and multilateral institutions. Lending by export credit agencies\u2014with the pure purpose of export promotion\u2014is excluded (http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm). \u201cDeveloping countries\u201d refer to countries, which are eligible to receive official development assistance (http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/daclist.htm). This limits the scope of reporting to those countries receiving water and sanitation ODA, and the number of such countries is expected to decrease going forward. Water and sanitation-related activities and programmes include those for water supply, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) (targets 6.1, 6.2), wastewater and water quality (6.3), water efficiency (6.4), water resource management (6.5), and water-related ecosystems (6.6). As per target 6.a wording, it includes activities and programmes for water harvesting, desalination, water efficiency, wastewater treatment, recycling and reuse technologies. A government coordinated spending plan is defined as a financing plan/budget for the water and sanitation sector, clearly assessing the available sources of finance and strategies for financing future needs.","computation_calculations":"The raw data underlying the United Kingdom Statistics on International Development was summed around appropriate aid description CRS codes, bilateral and multilateral classification, donor recipient countries, and type of aid codes.

Since volumes for electricity and heat in the final consumption table are not broken down by technology, electricity and heat output tables are used instead to break down final consumption of electricity and heat by technology. The allocation by technology is done by deriving the share of technology in electricity and heat output tables and multiplying that share by final energy consumption of electricity and heat, respectively. For instance, if total final consumption table reports 150 TJ for biogas energy, while total final consumption of electricity is 400 TJ and heat 100 TJ, and the share of biogas in total electricity output is 10 percent and 5 percent in heat, the total reported number for biogas consumption will be 195 TJ (150 TJ+400TJ*10%+100TJ*5%).

Other official flows (OOF): Other official flows (excluding officially supported export credits) are defined as transactions by the official sector which do not meet the conditions for eligibility as ODA, either because they are not primarily aimed at development, or because they are not sufficiently concessional (http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/documentupload/DCDDAC(2016)3FINAL.pdf - Para 24). Bilateral Aid:  Bilateral aid covers all aid provided by donor countries when the recipient country, sector or project is known. Bilateral aid also includes aid that is channelled through a multilateral organisation where the government department determines the country, sector or theme that the funds will be spent on. Multilateral Aid:  This is aid delivered in the form of core contributions to organisations on the DAC List of Multilateral Organisations.  Purpose Codes: The DAC (Development Assistance Committee) Secretariat maintains various code lists which are used by donors to report on their aid flows to the DAC databases.  In addition, these codes are used to classify information in the DAC databases.

According to the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED), education is defined as organized and sustained communication designed to bring about learning. Formal education is defined in ISCED as education that is institutionalized, intentional, and planned through public organizations and recognized private bodies and, in their totality, make up the formal education system of a country. Non-formal education, like formal education is defined in ISCED as education that is institutionalized, intentional and planned by an education provider but is considered an addition, alternative and/or a complement to formal education. It may be short in duration and/or low in intensity and it is typically provided in the form of short courses, workshops or seminars. Informal learning is defined in ISCED as forms of learning that are intentional or deliberate, but not institutionalized. It is thus less organized and less structured than either formal or non-formal education. Informal learning may include learning activities that occur in the family, in the work place, in the local community, and in daily life, on a self-directed, family-directed or socially-directed basis. For the purposes of this indicator, persons will be considered in education if they are in formal or non-formal education, as described above, but excluding informal learning. Persons in employment are defined as all those who, during a short reference period, were engaged in any activity to produce goods or provide services for pay or profit. They comprise - i) employed persons \u201cat work\u201d, i.e. who worked in a job for at least one hour; ii) employed persons \u201cnot at work\u201d due to temporary absence from a job, or to working-time arrangements (such as shift work, flexitime and compensatory leave for overtime). For the purposes of this indicator, persons are considered to be in training if they are in a non-academic learning activity through which they acquire specific skills intended for vocational or technical jobs. Vocational training prepares trainees for jobs that are based on manual or practical activities, and for skilled operative jobs, both blue and white collar related to a specific trade, occupation or vocation. Technical training on the other hand imparts learning that can be applied in intermediate-level jobs, in particular those of technicians and middle managers. The coverage of vocational and technical training includes only programmes that are solely school-based vocational and technical training. Employer-based training is, by definition, excluded from the scope of this indicator.","computation_calculations":"((Youth \u2013 Youth in employment \u2013 Youth not in employment but in education or training) / Youth) * 100","reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"graph_type":"line","graph_title":"Percentage of youth (aged 16-24 years) not in education, employment or training","data_show_map":false,"data_keywords":"Labour Force","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Office for National Statistics (ONS)","source_periodicity_1":"Quarterly","source_earliest_available_1":2002,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"United Kingdom","source_url_1":"https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peoplenotinwork/unemployment/datasets/youngpeoplenotineducationemploymentortrainingneettable1","source_url_text_1":"Young people not in education, employment or training (NEET)","source_release_date_1":"22/11/2018","source_next_release_1":"28/02/2019","source_statistical_classification_1":"National Statistic","source_contact_1":"EarlyYears.STATISTICS@education.gov.uk","source_other_info_1":"Source metadata - https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/qmis/labourforcesurveylfsqmi","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator_sort_order":"08-06-01","comments_limitations":"Data follows the UN specification for this indicator.

The World Bank, IMF and UNDP participate as observers. Official development assistance (ODA): The DAC defines ODA as \u201cthose flows to countries and territories on the DAC List of ODA Recipients and to multilateral institutions which are i) provided by official agencies, including state and local governments, or by their executive agencies; and ii) each transaction is administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective; and is concessional in character and conveys a grant element of at least 25 per cent (calculated at a rate of discount of 10 per cent) (http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm). Other official flows (OOF): Other official flows (excluding officially supported export credits) are defined as transactions by the official sector which do not meet the conditions for eligibility as ODA, either because they are not primarily aimed at development, or because they are not sufficiently concessional (http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/documentupload/DCDDAC(2016)3FINAL.pdf - Para 24). Bilateral Aid:  Bilateral aid covers all aid provided by donor countries when the recipient country, sector or project is known. Bilateral aid also includes aid that is channelled through a multilateral organisation where the government department determines the country, sector or theme that the funds will be spent on. Multilateral Aid:  This is aid delivered in the form of core contributions to organisations on the DAC List of Multilateral Organisations.  Purpose Codes: The DAC (Development Assistance Committee) Secretariat maintains various code lists which are used by donors to report on their aid flows to the DAC databases.  In addition, these codes are used to classify information in the DAC databases. The sector classification codes used can be found on the OECD website (http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/purposecodessectorclassification.htm). \"All donors\" refers to DAC donors, non-DAC donors and multilateral organisations.","computation_calculations":"The raw data underlying the United Kingdom Statistics on International Development was summed around appropriate aid description CRS codes, bilateral and multilateral classification, donor recipient countries, and type of aid codes.

Data are collected from Transport Ministries, statistical offices and other institution designated as official data source. Although there are clear definitions for all the terms used in this survey, countries might have different methodologies to calculate tonne-kilometres and passenger-kilometres. Methods could be based on traffic or mobility surveys, use very different sampling methods and estimating techniques which could affect the comparability of their statistics. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) through its Statistics Division have established standard methodologies and definitions to collect and report traffic (passenger and freight volume) data related to air transport. These standards and methodologies have been adopted by the 191 Member States of ICAO and also by the Industry stakeholders i,e air carriers and airports. The data of ICAO is used by States and also the World Bank for its development indicators. ICAO uses Air Transport Reporting Forms A, AS, B and C to arrive at the passenger and freight volumes for air transport. Precise definition of all different concepts and metadata related to Air Transport Reporting Forms A, AS, B and C to arrive at the passenger and freight volumes for air transport.
