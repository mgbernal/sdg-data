The definition used in the UK calculations only counts areas where the canopy covers more than 20%. Certification in the UK began in 1996, with data collation starting in 2001, becoming a regular annual collation in 2004.  New certificates may relate to existing woodland that was not previously certified, or to newly planted areas. Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.","national_data_update_url_text":"2019-04-29: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/ONSdigital/sdg-data/commit/254e81089efc9cb9c06405cd895afb3e1fe191b6","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2019-05-09: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/ONSdigital/sdg-data/commit/219b2d8548a059a3d5a6c362c750d0687605200b","page_content":"#### In **2018**\u2026 \n* The proportion of wooded area in the UK is at the highest point in the last 14 years at 13.1%.\n* Scotland has the largest area of woodland as a percentage of total land area in the UK followed by Wales, England then Northern Ireland.\n* Total wooded area has increased\nby 5.3% since 2004.\n\n#### See the [Forestry Commission report](https://www.forestresearch.gov.uk/tools-and-resources/statistics/forestry-statistics/) for more information.\n\n#### Information on [Natural Capital](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/bulletins/uknaturalcapital/landandhabitatecosystemaccounts#ecosystem-accounts-for-woodland/) is available from the Office for National Statistics.\n"}
