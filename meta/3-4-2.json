Due to the length of time it takes to complete a coroner's inquest, it can take months or even years for a suicide to be registered. 2) The large increase seen in Northern Ireland between 2004 and 2006 coincides with a change to the Coroners\u2019 Service. Prior to April 2006, there were seven Coroners\u2019 districts in Northern Ireland. Following a review of the Coroners\u2019 Service, the separate districts were amalgamated into one centralised Coroners\u2019 Service. 3) Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
