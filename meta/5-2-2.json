It includes acts of abusive sexual contact, forced engagement in sexual acts, attempted or completed sexual acts without consent, incest, sexual harassment, etc. However, in most surveys that collect data on sexual violence against women and girls by non-partners the information collected is limited to forcing someone into sexual intercourse when she does not want to, as well as attempting to force someone to perform a sexual act against her will or attempting to force her into sexual intercourse.","computation_calculations":"Number of women and girls subjected to sexual violence/total population of women and girls (aged 16 to 59) * 100. The disaggregated data are calculated by - Number of women and girls subjected to sexual violence in their given group / total population of women and girls (aged 16 to 59) in their given group * 100. For 'place of occurrence', 'relationship with perpetrator' and 'frequency of sexual assault', the denominator is based on the number of women and girls subjected to sexual violence.","reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"data_footnote":"1. The sample size is lower between 2010/11 and 2012/13 due to use of a split-sample experiment in these years. Please refer to the publication linked in the sources for further information. 2. Data broken down by 'place of occurrence', 'relationship with perpetrator' and 'frequency of sexual assault' are based on rape or assault by penetration (including attempts) experienced since the age of 16. If the victim had experienced more than one sexual assault, the most recent incident was reported for place of occurrence and relationship with perpetrator. These data use the number of women and girls who were victims of sexual assault as the denominator. 3. Data for some ethnic groups are unavailable due to small sample sizes. 4. Relationship with perpetrator - Other known includes date, friend, neighbour, an acquaintance (outside work or school/college/university), person in a position of trust or authority (not at work, school or university), colleague/peer from work or school/college/university. Percentages may sum to more than 100, as multiple perpetrators could be identified.","graph_type":"line","graph_title":"Percentage of women and girls aged 16 to 59 subjected to sexual assault","data_show_map":false,"data_keywords":"Crime, violence","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Office for National Statistics (ONS)","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":"2004/05","source_geographical_coverage_1":"England and Wales","source_url_1":"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/sexualoffencesappendixtables","source_url_text_1":"Sexual offences - appendix tables","source_release_date_1":"08/02/2018","source_next_release_1":"TBC","source_statistical_classification_1":"National Statistic","source_contact_1":"crimestatistics@ons.gov.uk","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator_sort_order":"05-02-02","comments_limitations":"This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator.
