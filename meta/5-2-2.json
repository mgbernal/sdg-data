The sample size is lower between 2010/11 and 2012/13 due to use of a split-sample experiment in these years. Please refer to the publication linked in the sources for further information. 2. Data broken down by 'place of occurrence', 'relationship with perpetrator' and 'frequency of sexual assault' are based on rape or assault by penetration (including attempts) experienced since the age of 16. If the victim had experienced more than one sexual assault, the most recent incident was reported for place of occurrence and relationship with perpetrator. These data use the number of women and girls who were victims of sexual assault as the denominator. 3. Data for some ethnic groups are unavailable due to small sample sizes. 4. Relationship with perpetrator - Other known includes date, friend, neighbour, an acquaintance (outside work or school/college/university), person in a position of trust or authority (not at work, school or university), colleague/peer from work or school/college/university. Percentages may sum to more than 100, as multiple perpetrators could be identified.","graph_type":"line","graph_title":"Percentage of women and girls aged 16 to 59 subjected to sexual assault","data_show_map":false,"data_keywords":"Crime, violence","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Office for National Statistics (ONS)","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":"2004/05","source_geographical_coverage_1":"England and Wales","source_url_1":"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/sexualoffencesappendixtables","source_url_text_1":"Sexual offences - appendix tables","source_release_date_1":"08/02/2018","source_next_release_1":"TBC","source_statistical_classification_1":"National Statistic","source_contact_1":"crimestatistics@ons.gov.uk","source_other_info_1":"Data acquired from the Crime Survey for England and Wales (Tables - 4, 10, 11, 15, 16, 17).","source_active_2":true,"source_organisation_2":"Office for National Statistics (ONS)","source_periodicity_2":"Annual","source_earliest_available_2":"2004/05","source_geographical_coverage_2":"England and Wales","source_url_2":"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/adhocs/10458percentageofadultsaged16to59whowerevictimsofsexualassaultincludingattemptsinthelastyearbyselectedpersonalorhouseholdcharacteristicsandsexyearendingmarch2018csew","source_url_text_2":"Percentage of adults aged 16 to 59 who were victims of sexual assault (including attempts) in the last year, by selected personal or household characteristics and sex, year ending March 2018, CSEW","source_release_date_2":"02/09/2019","source_next_release_2":"TBC","source_statistical_classification_2":"National Statistic","source_contact_2":"crimestatistics@ons.gov.uk","source_other_info_2":"Data acquired from the Crime Survey for England and Wales.","source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator_sort_order":"05-02-02","comments_limitations":"The Crime Survey for England and Wales includes a 'Nature of serious sexual assault' module where detailed data on sexual violence is collected every 3 years. This module was last included in the survey ending 2016/17. Therefore detailed breakdowns such as 'place of occurrence' and 'relationship with the perpetrator' are available for 2016/17 only. This module is only asked of respondents who have experienced rape or assault by penetration (including attempts) since the age of 16. The definition of disability used is consistent with the core definition of disability under the Equality Act 2010. A person is considered to have a disability if they have a long-standing illness, disability or impairment which causes difficulty with day-to-day. This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.","national_data_update_url_text":"2020-02-12: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/ONSdigital/sdg-data/commit/6cc467a19c04be1cd9c6fb2e1d1cfe843ebc9fe4","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2020-02-12: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/ONSdigital/sdg-data/commit/f99ca62405ddba6d61d39356182246fb1b4f44b0","page_content":"Select the following link to download this indicator data in an accessible format:<br>[5.2.2 Proportion of women and girls aged 15 years and older subjected to sexual violence by persons other than an intimate partner in the previous 12 months, by age and place of occurrence (CSV 13.105 kB)](https://sustainabledevelopment-uk.github.io/sdg-data/data/5-2-2.csv)"}
