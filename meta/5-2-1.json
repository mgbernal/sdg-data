The different forms of violence included in the indicator are defined as follows - i) Physical violence consists of acts aimed at physically hurting the victim and include, but are not limited to, pushing, grabbing, twisting the arm, pulling the hair, slapping, kicking, biting or hitting with the fist or object, trying to strangle or suffocate, burning or scalding on purpose, or threatening or attacking with some sort of weapon, gun or knife; ii) Sexual violence is defined as any sort of harmful or unwanted sexual behaviour that is imposed on someone. It includes acts of abusive sexual contact, forced engagement in sexual acts, attempted or completed sexual acts without consent, incest, sexual harassment, etc. In intimate partner relationships, experiencing sexual violence is commonly defined as being forced to have sexual intercourse, having sexual intercourse out of fear for what the partner might do, and/or being forced to so something sexual that the woman considers humiliating or degrading; iii) Psychological violence includes a range of behaviours that encompass acts of emotional abuse and controlling behaviour. These often coexist with acts of physical and sexual violence by intimate partners and are acts of violence in themselves.

For insight into the details of potential calculations please refer to the original source metadata or source contact. A basic summary of the concept  behind the formation of the indicator is as follows -  Taking the total number of women aged 16 to 59 in England and Wales who experienced any abuse by a partner or ex-partner in the past 12 months and divided this by the total number of women with the same age category in England/Wales and multiplied by 100.","reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"data_footnote":"The period April to March is being used to report annual data. The date on the X axis is the year at the start of the period. The sum of the overarching domestic abuse categories are not the sum of the sub-categories, as some victims may be included in multiple categories as they can experience more than one type of abuse.","graph_type":"line","graph_title":"Percentage of women who experienced partner abuse in the previous 12 months","data_show_map":false,"data_keywords":"Crime","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Office for National Statistics (ONS)","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":2004,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"England and Wales","source_url_1":"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/domesticabusefindingsfromthecrimesurveyforenglandandwalesappendixtables","source_url_text_1":"Domestic abuse - findings from the Crime Survey for England and Wales - Appendix tables","source_release_date_1":"22/11/2018","source_next_release_1":"TBA","source_statistical_classification_1":"National Statistic","source_contact_1":"crimestatistics@ons.gsi.gov.uk","source_other_info_1":"Tables 4, 5, 8 & 9 for 2017 figures","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator_sort_order":"05-02-01","comments_limitations":"Presently the only ages covered are between 16 and 59 but the upper bound of this is likely to increase over time.
