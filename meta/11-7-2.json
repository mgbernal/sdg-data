Presently the only ages covered are between 16 and 59 but the upper bound of this is likely to increase over time. The original figures refer to data that runs from April of that year to March the following year. For example 2015 data date range is from April 2015 to March 2016. The headline data are published in July, however the specific breakdowns (disaggregation\u2019s, i.e. age, gender, etc) are published in February. Coverage is limited to England and Wales.  This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.","national_data_update_url_text":"2017-10-27: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/ONSdigital/sdg-data/commit/99c85d4aff8982cc71cabd9b020d13c44d223222","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2019-08-06: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/ONSdigital/sdg-data/commit/f155f78bc1712d006921e2e062a70136c817e28c","page_content":"Select the following link to download this indicator data in an accessible format:<br>[11.7.2 Proportion of persons victim of physical or sexual harassment, by sex, age, disability status and place of occurrence, in the previous 12 months (CSV 7.208 kB)](https://sustainabledevelopment-uk.github.io/sdg-data/data/11-7-2.csv)"}
