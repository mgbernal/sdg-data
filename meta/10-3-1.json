In the United Kingdom, hate crime is defined as \u2018any criminal offence which is perceived, by the victim or any other person, to be motivated by hostility or prejudice towards someone based on a personal characteristic.\u2019 This common definition was agreed in 2007 by the police, Crown Prosecution Service, Prison Service (now the National Offender Management Service) and other agencies that make up the criminal justice system. There are five centrally monitored strands of hate crime - race or ethnicity; religion or beliefs; sexual orientation; disability; and transgender identity. In the process of recording a crime, police can flag an offence as being motivated by one or more of the five monitored strands listed above (for example, an offence can be motivated by hostility towards the victim\u2019s race and religion). Figures presented have been calculated from the total number of motivating factors.

Data may include multiple hate crime strands being assigned to an offence. An offence may be motivated by hatred towards a characteristic (strand) that is not centrally monitored and therefore would not be represented in this data (age or gender for example). Operationally, such an offence could still be investigated as a hate crime by the police.
