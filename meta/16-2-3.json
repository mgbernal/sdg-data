The 2015 to 2016 Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) ran for the first time a module of questions asking adults whether they were abused as a child. The module on abuse during childhood was added to the self completion section of the CSEW in place of the follow-up questions on serious sexual assault for survey year ending March 2016.   This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification.
