The Chained Volume Measures are created from the short term measures of output. The majority of indicators in the short term measures are measuring changes in output as a proxy for changes in GVA. At the reference year (currently 2015) the values are set equal to current price GVA values.","un_designated_tier":"Tier I","un_custodian_agency":"International Energy Agency (IEA), United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD), United Nations' inter-agency mechanism on energy (UN Energy) and the SE4ALL Global Tracking Framework Consortium","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-07-03-01.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 192 KB)","national_geographical_coverage":"United Kingdom","computation_units":"Terajoules per GBP (\u00a3m)","computation_definitions":"Total energy supply, as defined by the International Recommendations for Energy Statistics (IRES), as made up of production plus net imports minus international marine and aviation bunkers plus-stock changes.
