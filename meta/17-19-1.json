The World Bank, IMF and UNDP participate as observers. Official development assistance (ODA) - The DAC defines ODA as \u201cthose flows to countries and territories on the DAC List of ODA Recipients and to multilateral institutions which are i) provided by official agencies, including state and local governments, or by their executive agencies; and ii) each transaction is administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective; and is concessional in character and conveys a grant element of at least 25 per cent (calculated at a rate of discount of 10 per cent) (http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.html.  Bilateral Aid - Bilateral aid covers all aid provided by donor countries when the recipient country, sector or project is known. Bilateral aid also includes aid that is channelled through a multilateral organisation where the government department determines the country, sector or theme that the funds will be spent on. Multilateral Aid - This is aid delivered in the form of core contributions to organisations on the DAC List of Multilateral Organisations. Purpose Codes - The DAC (Development Assistance Committee) Secretariat maintains various code lists which are used by donors to report on their aid flows to the DAC databases. In addition, these codes are used to classify information in the DAC databases. The sector classification codes used can be found on the OECD website (http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/purposecodessectorclassification.html).","computation_calculations":"Volume of spend has been calculated using UK ODA spend on sector code 16062 \u2013 Statistical Capability Building (Both in National Statistical Offices and any other government ministries).
